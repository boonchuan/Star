        <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
        <ul>
<li><a href="#chapter1">Chapter 1 – The Shard of Heaven
When the shard of the Big Dipper broke through the void and struck the earth, it fused with the mutated remains of viral pandemics—COVID-19 and BSE—creating a devastating cosmic infection. Doctor Boon, a brilliant scientist, witnessed the devastation firsthand as cities collapsed into chaos. Determined to fight back, he gathered survivors and forged the Freeborn, uniting minds and technology to resist the spreading void corruption.</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter2">Chapter 2 – Flames of Renewal
High Priestess Nyra, guardian of ancient fire altars, heard the call of the celestial shard as it ignited sacred embers within the volcanic peaks. Channeling the Elemental Flame, she sought to cleanse the world of infection through ritual fire. Her followers embraced her vision of rebirth, seeing the inferno not as destruction but as the path to purging corruption and giving life a second chance.</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter3">Chapter 3 – Roots of Eternity
Deep in the heart of primeval forests, Virelia, a spirit-bonded warrior, communed with the ancient roots of the earth. As the infection spread, nature itself cried out in pain. Virelia fused her flame-touched powers with the will of the forest to create living sanctuaries, places where the infection could not reach. Her alliance, the Cradle of the Root, stood as the last bastion of balance between nature and fire.</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter4">Chapter 4 – The Codex Awakens
Sel of the Luminous uncovered the Cosmic Codex—a tome of infinite light and data threads, hidden for centuries in a celestial library. As she deciphered its runes, knowledge of the infection’s true nature came to light. The Codex of the Eternal Spark, Sel’s faction, emerged to preserve knowledge and wield the mystic energy of forgotten civilizations. Her mission: to reforge the link between cosmic truth and mortal existence.</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter5">Chapter 5 – Ashes of Vengeance
Ember Glow rose from the ashes of her destroyed homeland, her fury burning hotter than any flame. Once a humble warrior, she became an avatar of vengeance, leading the Ember Ashes—a faction dedicated to punishing those who had succumbed to the infection’s darkness. Her sword, forged from the remnants of celestial fire, blazed with unquenchable wrath, cutting through the void-born monstrosities.</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter6">Chapter 6 – The Void Dragon
From the cosmic rift above, Arkhelios Dragon descended—a colossal being born of void energy and the shard’s corruption. Its presence warped reality, spreading fear and despair. The Void Ones, remnants of the infection’s will, rallied under its shadow. The factions knew that to defeat Arkhelios would require an unprecedented alliance, yet old grudges stood in their way.</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter7">Chapter 7 – The Great Convergence
On the battlefield of fallen stars, the six factions clashed. The Freeborn’s strategies, Elemental Flame’s infernos, Cradle of the Root’s living fortresses, Codex of the Eternal Spark’s arcane shields, Ember Ashes’ relentless assaults, and the Void Ones’ dark tides collided in a storm of chaos. Betrayals and fragile alliances formed in the heat of battle as the fate of the world hung in the balance.</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter8">Chapter 8 – Starfall Cataclysm
The final confrontation ignited as Arkhelios unleashed its full power, merging void energy with celestial firestorms. Doctor Boon’s last gambit—a fusion of science and mysticism—sought to seal the cosmic rift forever. Each hero faced their destiny, and as the final star fell, the world teetered between annihilation and rebirth. Only the combined will of the factions could decide its fate.</a></li>
